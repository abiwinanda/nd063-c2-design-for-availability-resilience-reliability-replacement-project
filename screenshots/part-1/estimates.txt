The source database udacity is created in ap-southeast-1 with single AZ while the replica is created in ap-southeast-2 with single AZ as well.
Deploying udacity DB inside a DB subnet group allows the DB to be replicated across different AZ however since the DB is not replicated across AZ
in this case than an outage of a single AZ would not make any different than an outage of a single zone. If a single AZ is down and the DB is not accessible 
then the whole application can be considered not available. Assuming we want to redirect all the DB trafic to the standby DB in the secondary region then promoting
secondary DB as primary would take about 10 minutes, hence the RTO is 10 minutes. How much the RPO? The fact that the application is not available in the first 
place means that user can't injest any data since the outage hence the RPO will be 0 in this case. In other word no data is lost but not data can be inserted. 
If single zone outage happen the solution is the same as before which is to redirect db traffic to the secondary region hence the RTO and RPO stays the same 
which is 10 minues and 0 respectively.
