The source database udacity is created in ap-southeast-1 with multiple AZ while the replica is created in ap-southeast-2 with single AZ.
When a DB failed in one AZ, there will be an automatic failover which is done by the DB instance in another AZ. Failover between AZs usually
happened quickly. According to AWS RDS feature site, this takes about 1 or even less than a minute. Hence the RTO and RPO for a single AZ outage is
one minute. For the case of a single region outage, the secondary DB has to be promoted first before it could be used. This could take manual steps
which further increase the RTO and RPO. Promoting replicate DB as primary took about 10 minutes in my project. Assuming that manual steps takes
about 5 minutes (calling technician, login, mfa, promoting DB) then the RTO and RPO for a single region outage is 15 minutes.
